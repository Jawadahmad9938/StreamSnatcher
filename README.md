```

### Step 2: Install FFmpeg

#### Windows:
1. Download FFmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ (download the "full" build)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\`)
3. Add FFmpeg to your system PATH:
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties"
   - Click on "Advanced system settings"
   - Click on "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", find and select the "Path" variable
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the path to the FFmpeg bin folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`)
   - Click "OK" to close all dialogs
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
   You should see FFmpeg version information if installed correctly.

5. Update the `SYSTEM_FFMPEG_PATH` in `main.py`:
   ```python
   SYSTEM_FFMPEG_PATH = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
